# water-monitor



The goal of this project is to form a development community around the STORC facility on the CSU Sacramento campus.
The STORC (Sustainable Technology Optimization and Research Center)
is a facility geared towards the research and implementation of sustainable technology.

The water-monitor project is aimed at producing a relatively inexpensive,
scalable, and scientifically precise water monitoring solution for hydroponic and aquaponic food production systems.
Providing invaluable experimental feedback for cutting edge research in the field of aquaponics.

 Version 0.1 and 0.2 is deprecated.

The current system version 1.0 uses an arduino UNO for real-time sensor control, with the tentacle shield from whiteboxlabs for the atlas scientific sensors.
