The goal of this project is to form a development community around the STORC facility on the CSU Sacramento campus. 
The STORC (Sustainable Technology Optimization and Research Center) 
is a facility geared towards the research and implementation of sustainable technology.

The water-monitor project is aimed at producing a relatively inexpensive, 
scalable, and scientifically precise water monitoring solution for hydroponic and aquaponic food production systems. 
Providing invaluable experimental feedback for cutting edge research in the field of aquaponics.
